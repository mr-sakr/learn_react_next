* Problem : You may see the error red underline import or export words, and if you go to this word to check the error,
You will find the error as follows :
    nextjs Parsing error: Cannot find module 'next/babel'

Solution : 
    In your NextJS Project you have this file , named .eslintrc.json, In this file you have following code

    {
    "extends": "next/core-web-vitals"
    }

    Replace it with 

    {
    "extends": ["next/babel","next/core-web-vitals"]
    }

    Note: If you only replace with

    {
    "extends": ["next/babel"]
    }
    The red error sign will go but the code won't compile and gives compile error.
