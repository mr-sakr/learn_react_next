* Note that useState became used only in client component not server component and the rest of hooks also.

So, to use useState, you must write 'use client' in the beginning of the client component to identify it.


we must import useState firstly like this : import { useState } from "react"

we must use useState inside the body of the function component.

--------------------

If we need to use (for) attr. to any element, we must write it as follows : (htmlFor)
Like changing (class) to (className).
