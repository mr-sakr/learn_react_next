* We create this app using src

* In src/app : You can find the file of page.js 
This file is consider the home page, in this version, page.js is like index.js

* If you need to create folder posts for example, you must create a file in a name of page.js also as an index


* You can add classes in globals.css and use this className in the files, because this file is a global,
not customised for one file only, because it was imported in layout.js file.
