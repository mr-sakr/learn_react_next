Before, in pages router : the Head component was used as follows :
    import Head from "next/head"

    export default function Home() {
    return (
        <main>
            <Head>
                <title>Home Page</title>
            </Head>
            <h1>This is : Home Page</h1>
            <h2>
                <Link href="/contact">Contact Page</Link>
            </h2>
        </main>
    )
    }

But, now in App router, we don't import Head component nor use it, 
but export const by name metadata as follows :

    export const metadata = {
        title: 'Contact Page',
        description: 'Contact Us we are here',
    }
